# Calendar Flyout

Welcome to the official issue-only repo for Calendar Flyout. Calendar Flyout is a desktop app that brings back agenda and clock with seconds to Windows 11. It primarily uses WPF and UWP (as XAML Islands).

Only Outlook personal calendars are synchronized properly. For other calendars (e.g., Google, Yahoo) you need to open Windows Calendar app to synchronize your appointments.
